# Tic-Tac-Toe App

## Description
The Tic-Tac-Toe App is a simple web-based game developed using JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (X or O). The game provides real-time feedback on the current turn and announces the winner when one player achieves a winning combination.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features
- Two-player gameplay.
- Real-time turn indication.
- Winning combination detection.
- Audio feedback for turn changes and game outcomes.
- Reset button to restart the game.

## JavaScript Learnings
The JavaScript code for this app demonstrates several key concepts, including:
- **Event Handling**: Use of event listeners to detect user clicks on game grid elements.
- **Game Logic**: Implementation of game logic to alternate turns between players, mark spaces, and check for winning combinations.
- **Audio Integration**: Incorporation of audio elements to provide feedback on turn changes and game outcomes.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Updating the DOM to reflect changes in game state, such as displaying current turn information and announcing the winner.
